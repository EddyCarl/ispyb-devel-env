# Vagrant Development Environment for ISPyB Web Services

This VM is only designed as a standalone setup.

Note: - this currently uses the openjdk - might need to change this for oracle one...

## Role order
The database role relies on importing sql files from the ISPyB github repo.

Therefore the webserver role should be configured (listed) first.

## Post provision steps
Once deployed you will need to login to the VM (vagrant ssh) and build the software. 

If all goes well the depdendencies will be created for the vagrant user. If not go to /opt/ispyb/dependencies and run 'mvn initialize'.

To build go to /opt/ispyb and run 'mvn package'. This builds the web services, database layer and the ui all bundled into an ear.

## Deploy to Wildfly
